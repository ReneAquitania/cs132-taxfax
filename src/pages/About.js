                We are TaxFax, bringing you the facts regarding tax. In this project, 
                we analyze the deceptive tweets about the 203 Billion estate tax case of the Marcoses. <br /><br />
                It is our belief in TaxFax that everyone is responsible for paying their taxes; 
                it is our civil duty. This is why we chose the topic: to wake the people up from the Marcoses 
                feigning of responsibility. We're not sure if this will be trusted by the public, 
                but we will strive to find the truth.
